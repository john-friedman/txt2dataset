## Installation

```
pip install txt2dataset
```

## Quickstart

### Initialization
```
from txt2dataset import DatasetBuilder

builder = DatasetBuilder(input_path,output_path)

# set api key
builder.set_api_key(api_key)

# set base prompt, e.g. what the model looks for
base_prompt = """Extract officer changes and movements to JSON format.
    Track when officers join, leave, or change roles.
    Provide the following information:
    - date (YYYYMMDD)
    - name (First Middle Last)
    - title
    - action (one of: ["HIRED", "RESIGNED", "TERMINATED", "PROMOTED", "TITLE_CHANGE"])
    Return an empty dict if info unavailable."""

# set what the model should return
response_schema = {
    "type": "ARRAY",
    "items": {
        "type": "OBJECT",
        "properties": {
            "date": {"type": "STRING", "description": "Date of action in YYYYMMDD format"},
            "name": {"type": "STRING", "description": "Full name (First Middle Last)"},
            "title": {"type": "STRING", "description": "Official title/position"},
            "action": {
                "type": "STRING", 
                "enum": ["HIRED", "RESIGNED", "TERMINATED", "PROMOTED", "TITLE_CHANGE"],
                "description": "Type of personnel action"
            }
        },
        "required": ["date", "name", "title", "action"]
    }
}

# Optional configurations
builder.set_rpm(1500)
builder.set_save_frequency(100)
builder.set_model('gemini-1.5-flash-8b')
```

### Build the dataset
```
builder.build(base_prompt=base_prompt,
               response_schema=response_schema,
               text_column='text',
               index_column='accession_number',
               input_path="data/msft_8k_item_5_02.csv",
               output_path='data/msft_officers.csv')
```

### Standardize the dataset
```
builder.standardize(response_schema=response_schema,input_path='data/msft_officers.csv', output_path='data/msft_officers_standardized.csv',columns=['name'])
```

### Validate the dataset
```
results = builder.validate(input_path='data/msft_8k_item_5_02.csv',
                 output_path= 'data/msft_officers_standardized.csv', 
                 text_column='text',
                 index_column='accession_number', 
                 base_prompt=base_prompt,
                 response_schema=response_schema,
                 n=5,
                 quiet=False)
```

#### Example Validation Output
```
[{
    "input_text": "Item 5.02 Departure of Directors... Kevin Turner provided notice he was resigning his position as Chief Operating Officer of Microsoft.",
    "process_output": [{
        "date": 20160630,
